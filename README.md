# Python-class
Python programming and data analysis class at Warsaw University of Technology at Faculty of Electrical Engineering

Purpose of the course:
Attendants will get familiar with Python language programming and practical applications of this environment in data analysis. During the course (on the lectures) examples of real world problems will be developped. The application will be related to electrical engineering data processing as well as more general data processing problems (eq. radiology). Developed applications will process input data, optimize data in Python language and present the results in form of tables and plots.
